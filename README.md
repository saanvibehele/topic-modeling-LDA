# topic-modeling-LDA

This project mainly focuses on identifying topics by creating clusters using the tweets provided in the dataset. This is achieved by implementing LDA i.e., Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Datasets considered in this project are Covid tweets, disaster tweets, stock tweets, Trump tweets, and other general tweets which include attributes like tweets, emoji free tweets, URL free tweets, tokens, tokens back to text, and lemmas. In this project, we intend to segregate these tweets into topics based on the mentioned attributes and determining the most frequently used words for every individual topic. The project is made on Jupyter Notebook platform using various python libraries and functions which include some of the visualization tools and several Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries as well. Lastly, the model calculates the perplexity and coherence score to determine the uncertainty between the topics and to measure how well our topic model represents a coherent set of topics.
